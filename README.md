# 2DTourGame
Strategic game in tours made with C++
Project is made in UE5.1. Visuals are made in sprites, rest of it will be added in near future.
Logic is split by rule one file - one actor/asset. It helps keeping project robust and legible.
Technologies and its usage in project:
*Sprites - Characters and buildings, enemies etc.
*Enhanced Input - ability to walk
*UI like Menu
Now in works is original Tour system, rooted by Gamemode and various statistics
